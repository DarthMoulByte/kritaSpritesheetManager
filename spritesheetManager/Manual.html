<h3>Spritesheet manager: imports, exports and merges spritesheets</h3>

<br>
<h3>Why use it</h3>
<p>
Most pixel art games use spritesheets for their animations, but manually exporting from the animation timeline is a pain, effectively destroys your animation if you do it on the same file, and with every new modification you need to start all over again.
</p>

<p>
This plugin is threefold: <br>
- <b>export</b>: it allows you to easily export the active animation as a spritesheet.<br>
- <b>merge</b>: in case you have several animations on different layers, or just want to make a spritesheet from previously-exported images, it lets you merge external image files afterwards, without needing to necessarily import them into krita.<br>
- <b>import</b>: and you can also import a spritesheet (or part of one) to the animation timeline.<br>
</p>

<br>
<h3>How to use it</h3>
<h4>Exporting a single animation</h4>
<p>
<b>Tools > Scripts > SpritesheetManager > Export Spritesheet</b> will export the animation from the currently selected document's animation timeline.<br>
Export direction is horizontal then vertical. For example, in a 3*2 grid, frame numbers are as follows:<br>
1, 2, 3<br>
4, 5, 6<br>
<br>
<b>Options:</b><br>
<b>export name</b>: if you type in "exportName", the name of the individual exported frames will be exportName_000.png, exportName_001.png, etc., and the spritesheet will be called exportName.png . If your name contains a comma, anything after the first comma will be ignored, and the file will still export as a png.<br>
<b>export directory</b>: select the folder in which the spritesheet will be exported (the frames will be exported in a subfolder of the export directory called exportName_sprites)<br>
<b>rows</b>: select the number of rows. If 0, the script will guess it using the number of columns.<br>
<b>columns</b>: select the number of columns. If 0, the script will guess it using the number of rows (it might change the number of rows to respect the horizontal priority)<br>
If both rows and columns are set to 0, the default value will be used for both <i>(I'm torn between the default being one row or a square-ish image, I'd love to hear what other people think about this)</i><br>
<b>start</b> and <b>end</b>: the start and end of the animation to export to spritesheet. Anything outside those values will not be considered.<br>
If end is set to 0, it will use the default value for both (that is, the Start/End frames of the document (visible in the Animation widget); as such, it may be easier to set them before exporting by right clicking on the timeline and Set Start/End Frame, then leave it at 0 in the export dialog)<br>
<b>remove temporary folder</b>: whether to remove the folder containing the individual exported sprites once finished. You'll usually want this on, but you do you.<br>

<h3>Notes</h3>
<p> You can't export as anything other than .png because jpg is the ugliest thing ever with pixel art. If someone finds it useful to have actual export options and doesn't want to do it themselves tell me and I'll think about it</p>
